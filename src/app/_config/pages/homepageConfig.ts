                body: `We hired Marcus in January to help us with an extremely anxious dog. She is a rescue, and we did initial training with another company (not extensive but we learned basics for establishing trust with anxious dogs). We really wanted her to start to feel comfortable in her new environment so we held off on more training for three months, but I’m not sure that helped. By the time we reached out to Marcus, she was always glued to a corner in the house or her crate, and would not enjoy human interactions or toys.

Fast forward through 8 weeks of hands-on training and this girl is confident, loves to go on walks, and cuddles on the couch. She is so much more personable than we could imagine. Marcus’s training methods were very effective and what we appreciated most, he pivoted goals based on her progress that week.

I would say the at-home training program is for people dedicated to giving their dog the time and energy they deserve to help improve relationships and build the dogs confidence (if that’s what you need). We were diligent about the training process on the days between sessions which led to success. Marcus is so knowledgeable and gives you the tools to succeed so it’s not too difficult. We plan to continue our basic training for now but enroll our sweet girl in the e-collar training program soon!`,

                body: `Working with Marcus has been the best dog training experience we have ever had!

Our dog Lily, who we adopted as a 2.5 year old, has had anxiety and fear towards humans since we got her. As she has gotten older, her reactivity worsened and culminated to multiple bite attempts. After researching multiple dog training companies, we came across Marcus. From the beginning, Marcus was kind, professional, and showed full faith in being able to work with us on this horrible situation!

We completed an intensive 10 week one on one training with Marcus and Lily has basically become a different dog!! Working with Marcus is SO easy - he is accessible and always asks us to text him any questions, give updates, etc, and he is so responsive, and flexible to rescheduling. He is also kind and understanding of our questions and fears as owners of a reactive dog, and has had full faith in Lily this entire process.

He is extremely knowledgeable of dog training methods and dog behavior/psychology. He explains the why and works with you so you really understand each step, and how they build on each other. His training program is comprehensive and intensive, and he provides support and resources every step of the way. We were able to work on things like “state of mind”, place, muzzle training, heeling on leash, and so much more.

because of this we were able to address lilys dangerous behaviors. This has given us such peace of mind as anxious dog owners. We can now walk/run with Lily safely, take her into stores, and have her around when new people come to visit. We are SO lucky to have found Marcus and can’t wait to keep working with him!!`,

                body: `Hands down the best dog trainer ever. My wife and I decided to sign up for the Evolved Private Training package for our newly adopted rescue who was completely untrained and had some severe signs of general and separation anxiety pretty early on. Marcus helped us navigate the steps to getting our new dog to a state where she fits into our lives.

Before we met Marcus, our dog would tremble and cower from any stranger, not listen to anything we said, and often would scream if we left her alone. After completing the evolved private training package our dog now knows how to sit, place, down, recall, heel, and settle herself when alone. Marcus has spent countless hours with us via lesson, texting and calling us to talk through how best to address issues we are experiencing, and really prioritize our training goals. His approach really connected with us and our dog, he showed that he was willing to do whatever it took to meet our training goals and have our dog fit into our lives.

I also think his rates are a phenomenally good deal. He not only provides the lessons as advertised but works with you to ensure you get the equipment you need to accomplish your training goals, even if he has to loan you equipment or go out of his way to make adjustments. I would have paid him more in a heartbeat if he asked.

I would hands down go with Marcus for making your pup fit into your life and be happy while doing it.`,

I'm writing this review for Marcus and the amazing job he has done and continues to do for our beautiful girl Suki and for my wife and I also. We did the 2 week board and train program with Marcus because our girl was a very anxious rescue. We could see that she had a lot of potential, but we didn't know how to get the most out of her. Our goal wasn't that we wanted her to just learn to obey and respect us, but to know that she is part of our family and that we just want to communicate with her so she can be safe and so we can also be able to have a good and mutually respectful relationship with her. Marcus 100% delivered on all of it helping us to achieve our goal. Our amazing girl is living up to the potential we saw in her and we also as her family have learned how to navigate having her do what we need her to do while also having a fun time with our girl. All of this thanks to Marcus and his very open communication and feedback for us. Don't be fooled by the smaller amount of reviews his business seems to have, he is a seasoned veteran in this area and I will always recommend him. Thank you! See you soon Marcus.`,

Marcus has this amazing ability to look at the whole picture—helping with not just training but creating a toolkit for you and your dog to actually communicate in a way that makes sense. It’s not just about commands—it’s about building a real connection.

Over a year later, Watson had a health issue, and I wasn’t sure if that would change how we’d been working together. I reached out to Marcus, and he jumped right in. He genuinely cared and wanted to help us navigate the situation. His advice and encouragement reminded me why he’s so great at what he does—he’s not just about training, he’s about making sure you and your dog thrive.

If your dog deals with anxiety, separation anxiety, defensiveness, or aggression, or if you’re just looking to feel more confident with your pup, Marcus is your guy. He knows so much, and if there’s something he’s not sure of, he’ll dig into his resources to find answers. Thanks to him, we’ve been able to take Watson to friends’ houses and even breweries again, which felt impossible before.

Marcus is just the best—kind, knowledgeable, and so easy to work with. If you’re thinking about getting help with your dog, seriously, don’t wait. Call Evolve K9 Training. You won’t regret it!`,

I was in no way prepared to take on 2 young, medium to large dogs and felt overwhelmed every day. Someone referred me to Marcus, and it literally changed my life. I have had dog trainers before (not with these dogs) and somehow it really didn't stick. Marcus is thoughtful and takes the time, to give me what I need to make sure my dog Zen was able to keep all his good learned habits. He now walks perfectly at heel, stops when I say, and does not react to dogs or squirrels. A first! He goes into his kennel, understands and does "place" when I need him to. I cannot stay enough good things. Marcus is everything a trainer should be, and I am so grateful to him`,
